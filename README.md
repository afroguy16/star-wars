# Description

A star wars planets inhabitant search tool. A JSON file is used and no real API call is made. Refer to the document for full description.

## Setup

Setup is easy, you will be up and running in a couple of steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm start` and it should open automatically in your browswer. You could also visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or whatever url shows up in your terminal. It's going to start with `http:localhost`, but could be suffixed by any open port in your local machine.

## Testing

I attempted to build with TDD (Test driven development), and have as much test coverage as quickly as possible.
To test the application, in your terminal, run `npm test`

## UI Design

UI design is moderate, not too sophisticated. Readibily of content is the focus and the goal wasn't to get the prettiers design possible, but to get a clean demo code that works well.
